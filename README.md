# FUT Team Builder

## Project Overview

The FUT Team Builder allows users to create their custom Ultimate Team (FUT) by adding, positioning, and modifying players while respecting tactical formations like 3-5-2 or 4-3-3. The application focuses on providing an interactive experience with dynamic forms, localStorage data management, and an engaging interface for users to manage their team efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Player Addition**: Users can add players via a form, including fields for name, position, rating, and other relevant stats.
  
- **Tactical Formation Support**: The app supports predefined tactical formations, including:
  - **4-3-3**: 1 GK, 2 CB, 1 LB, 1 RB, 3 CM, 1 LW, 1 RW, 1 ST

  Players will be positioned according to the selected formation, with automatic adjustments.

- **Player Card Management**: Users can add, modify, and delete player cards. The team is limited to 11 main players, with additional players reserved for substitutions.

- **Form Field Validation**: All player input fields (name, position, rating) are validated to ensure data consistency.

- **LocalStorage Support**: Team and player data are saved to localStorage, allowing users to retrieve their team setup when reopening the app.

- **Dynamic Formation Change**: The layout and player positions update automatically when changing the selected tactical formation.

- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal user experience across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the application.
- **CSS**: Native CSS or CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap) for styling.
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS for dynamic content and interaction.
- **localStorage**: For storing player and formation data locally.
